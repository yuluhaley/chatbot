The data frame has columns of the room number, floor plan, square feet, rent, tenant name, tenant date of birth, tenant job,  lease begin date. Assume the apartment has 16 floors, each floor has 20 rooms. There are 4 floor plans:\n",

Each floor has 5 rooms of 1b1b(550 square feet), 5 rooms of  1b1b(750 square feet), 5 rooms of 2b1b, 5 rooms of 2b2b. Assume there are 20 rooms empty(without tenants) now (randomly selected)"

        "Displaying Available Options:\n",
        "Based on the user's budget and preferences, the chatbot showcases a list of suitable apartments, detailing the floor, floor plan, square footage, and rent.\n",
        "Users can then select their preferred apartment type from the list.\n",
        "Scheduling the Tour:\n",
        "The chatbot provides a list of available dates for the upcoming three days, allowing users to pick their preferred date.\n",
        "Once the date is chosen, the chatbot displays available time slots for that specific day. Users can then select their desired time.\n",
        "Upon finalizing the date and time, the chatbot confirms the scheduled tour, providing users with a summary of their appointment details.\n",
        "Data Collection & Analysis:\n",
        "The system maintains a record of all bookings, capturing details like the recommended apartment types and chosen tour times.\n",
        "Recommendation Analysis: By evaluating the frequency of each recommended apartment type, the property management gains insights into potential renters' preferences. This data can influence decisions regarding apartment promotions or availability adjustments.\n",

        "how to extend the work：This code segment is designed to segment tenants into distinct clusters based on several features: the number of people, their budget, annual income, whether they have pets, and the distance from their work location. By standardizing the data, we ensure that each feature contributes equally to the clustering process. The KMeans algorithm is then employed to group the tenants into three distinct clusters. By examining the centers of these clusters, we can derive average characteristics for each group. With the integration of new data, this clustering approach can offer valuable insights into the diverse profiles of tenants, helping property managers tailor their services, marketing strategies, and amenities to better cater to the specific needs and preferences of each tenant group\n"
